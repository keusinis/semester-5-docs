    \subsection{Leader} Our leader is \textbf{Rytis Tauras} and the co-leader is Matas ÄŒeplinskas.\\[0,25cm] We decided on it by letting AI analyze our abilities and randomly generating 30 votes on who should take the lead.\\[0,25cm]
    \textbf{Leaders responsibilities:} organizing meetings, managing the main repository, identifying tasks for a given time period, communication with lecturer.\\[0,25cm]
    \textbf{Leader authority:} strong worded letters, mandatory private meetings for rule breaking, ability to designate part of their responsibilities to another team member.
    The reason we chose this method is because we wanted a method between democracy and chance.
